There are obvious opportunities for refactoring (page objects, refining the regex to potentially eliminate step definitions) but I wanted to get this submitted. 

A few notes:
- Date test fails because the site doesn't update to today's date
- The language choices have moved from when the original README was written
- info.cukes has moved to io.cucumber which changed some of the imports
- I was unable to run Firefox Driver because my laptop won't recognize it as from a trusted developer. This appears to be a known issue for some people running on macs.

Thank you for your time,
Ander Murane
