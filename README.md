A few notes:
- Date test fails because the site doesn't update to today's date
- The language choices have moved from when the original README was written
- info.cukes has moved to io.cucumber which changed some of the imports
- I used Chromdriver over Firefox Driver to run locally - this laptop won't recognize it as from a trusted developer. This appears to be a known issue for some macs

Thanks for your time,
Ander
